anatomy of fascism

fascism was the major political innovation of the twentieth century, and
the source of much of its pain. the other major currents of modern western
political culture conservatism, liberalism, socialism all reached mature
form between the late eighteenth century and the mid nineteenth century.
fascism, however, was still unimagined as late as the 1890s. friedrich
engels, writing a preface in 1895 for his new edition of karl marxs the
class struggles in france, clearly believed that wider suffrage would
inexorably deliver more votes to the left. both time and numbers, engels
was certain, were on the socialists side.
