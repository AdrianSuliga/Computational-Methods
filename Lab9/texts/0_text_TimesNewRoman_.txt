chapter 1 commodities

the wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself
as an immense accumulation of commodities,1 its unit being a single commodity. our
investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.
a commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies
human wants of some sort or another. the nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring
from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference.2 neither are we here concerned to know
how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or indirectly as
means of production.
